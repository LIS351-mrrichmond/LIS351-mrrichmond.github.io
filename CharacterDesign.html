<h1>My Character Designs</h1>


<p>Character design is one of my favorite art forms
no matter what medium I'm using. For these particular
designs I used Adobe Photoshup. These characters
are meant to exist in a fantasy-themed racing board
game concept that I have been working on. Below is
a list of their names and in-game abilities.</p>
